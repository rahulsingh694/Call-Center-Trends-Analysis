# Call-Center-Trends-Analysis
This is an in depth analysis of dataset of a call centre. I have prepared an interactive Power BI dashboard which is easy to unerstand. It includes important Key Performace Indicators(KPIs) like Agent Statistics, Average Customer Satisfaction Rating, Calls Answered and Percentage of Calls Resolved and during which Hour of the Day Maximum Calls were made, etc.
